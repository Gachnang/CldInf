# CloudInf - Lab 3 - Single Docker host and KVM
This repository contains nodejs code for a multi tier application. Its your job to make it runnable on a Docker host.

The application overview is as follows:
```bash
traefik <=> web <=> api <=> db
```

The web component should be accessable via [https://groupX.playground.ins.hsr.ch/](https://groupX.playground.ins.hsr.ch/). For further requirements/informations have a look at the lab instructions.
